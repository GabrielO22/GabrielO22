                <h2>Hi there, I'm Gabriel!</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a third-year Software Engineering student at the University of California, Irvine who loved coding and
                    learning about the vast field that is computer science. While I haven't yet worked in the tech industry, I 
                    have a passion, curiosity, and a drive to learn and grow as a developer. I have taken classes in which I learned
                    Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Agile Development, Web Development, Cencepts in
                    Programming Languages, and more. I would also consider myself a strong devleoper in Java, C++, Python, HTML, and
                    CSS, while I also quickly am expanding my skillset to include JavaScript, C, C#, and SQL.
